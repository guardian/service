Service
=======

Defines a Service abstraction for apps in the cloud.

## Purpose

When running several small services, as opposed to a few very big
ones, it is useful to standardise certain elements.

Benefits include: improved developer understanding (born out of
familiarity), and the emergence of generic tools - for things such as
monitoring and alerting - which can improve quality and reduce
duplication of effort across projects.

To clarify what needs standardising, we define a 'Service'
abstraction, in effect a contract which services should meet to be
production ready.

Service is initially a product of the Guardian Discussion team.
